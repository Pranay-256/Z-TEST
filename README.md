# Z-TEST

The Z-test is a basic statistical tool used to determine if a specific observation (like the average of a sample) is significantly different from a standard or expected value (like the known population average).

Key Idea
The Z-test essentially asks: "Is this difference I observed just due to random chance, or is it a real, meaningful difference?"

When to Use It
You use a Z-test primarily when:

You have a large amount of data (a large sample size).

You know the standard deviation (the measure of variability) of the entire population you are studying.

How It Works (Conceptually)
It calculates a value called the Z-score. This score measures how many "standard steps" (standard deviations) your sample average is away from the expected population average.

If the Z-score is very high or very low (far from zero), it means your sample average is an unlikely result if the null hypothesis (that there is no difference) were true.

Based on this, you decide whether the difference you observed is statistically significant (meaning you reject the idea that the two values are the same) or not.
